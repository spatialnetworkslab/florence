    <h1>Florence</h1>
    <h2>
      A data visualization framework,
      based on the grammar of graphics,
      built on top of Svelte's template syntax
    </h2>
  </div>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      Florence is built on top of existing open web standards that are already in intensive use for online map making today,
       but provides a framework that is firmly based on cartographic and visualization theory. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We adopt concepts from Bertin’s Semiology of Graphics and Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics to create a ‘language’ with
       a limited number of core concepts or verbs that are combined with a declarative style of ‘writing’ visualizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a sense of the range of visualizations made possible 
      using the library, check out the examples in the gallery
      or visit the tutorials & documentation.
