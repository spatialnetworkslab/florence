# Donut Chart

A donut chart showing the estimated population per age group in the U.S. in 2015. Adapted from https://observablehq.com/@d3/donut-chart. Data can be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mbostock/a3541c73fdccd432acc8b11bf9f02641/raw/2bd0fce0bf34b020e93c5f6527b5a9d08c33ff06/population-by-age.csv).

The `(async () => { ... })()` bit is a so-called [Immediately Invoked Function Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE), which is just a way to define a function and run it immediately without having to give it a name. It is used here to contain all logic that depends on asynchronous operations like fetching datasets.
