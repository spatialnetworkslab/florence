# Brush

An example setup for a brush interaction. Draw a selection rectangle in the scatterplot with your mouse. After that, drag the rectangle around, and notice that the average x and y values of the points within the selection are updated. Of course, this particular use of brushing is not super useful, but is intended to illustrate how easy `florence` interactions integrate with the rest of the web page.
