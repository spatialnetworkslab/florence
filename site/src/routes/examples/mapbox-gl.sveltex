# Basemap with Mapbox GL

An example of 'syncing' the coordinate system used in Florence with the web Mercator system often used in map libraries such as Leaflet or Openlayers.
Here an example is given with Mapbox GL and two ways of syncing, a 'naive' implementation and a more performant approach that uses Florence's built-in zoom functionality.
